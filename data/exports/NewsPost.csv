Our response to the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper,post-16-white-paper,68fb370f70dcd22b7151ff7b,Jeremy Swan,Our response to the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper,"<blockquote><strong>Following the publication of the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper, Martin Edmondson, Chief Executive of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) said:</strong>&nbsp;</blockquote><p><br></p><p>“We welcome the Government’s recognition of the huge potential of our universities to drive economic growth, deliver a pipeline of critical skills, and break down barriers to opportunity. Demand for higher-level skills is only set to grow, and we support the ambition for universities to play an even greater role in meeting the local and regional skills needs that underpin the UK’s economic success.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“As we tackle global challenges and embrace rapid technological change, higher education has a central role in equipping people with the skills, adaptability, and innovation needed for the future. To achieve this, high-quality careers guidance and work-integrated learning must feature throughout the student journey, ensuring opportunities are open to people from all backgrounds and career stages.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“University careers and employability teams are critical to this mission. Their professional expertise should be at the heart of shaping institutional strategy on employability, supported by adequate resourcing and close collaboration with academic colleagues. Employability strategies that combine professional insight with academic specialism are vital to producing graduates ready to thrive in the modern economy. Employability experts are also vital in building local partnerships to ensure that regions develop the right mix of skills pipelines.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Across the sector, universities are already making great strides in this space. We see this demonstrated in the achievements recognised through our annual&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.agcas.org.uk/aea26"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: gray;"">Academic Employability Awards</a>. These examples showcase what’s possible when institutions invest in employability, actively develop skills in curriculum, collaborate with employers, and empower their students to connect learning with real-world opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>",,"[]","[]",published,2025-10-21T10:15:00.000Z,Our response to the Post-16 White Paper,Our response to the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper,69204a09bf579bb673c1489f,2025-11-21T11:16:25.052000,2025-11-21T13:21:51.733000,anonymous,anonymous,false
AGCAS response to the Department for Business and Trade consultation on unpaid internships,consultation-on-unpaid-internships,68fb370f70dcd22b7151ff7b,Jeremy Swan,Our response to the Department for Business and Trade consultation on Making Work Pay: unpaid internships,"<p>We recently responded to the Department for Business and Trade consultation on&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/making-work-pay-call-for-evidence-on-unpaid-internships"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: gray;""><strong>Making Work Pay: unpaid internships</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>You can find the full response&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.agcas.org.uk/write/MediaUploads/Resources/AGCASresponsetoMakingWorkPay.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: gray;"">here</a>, but in summary we welcome the Government’s focus on fair and inclusive work experience. We strongly support payment for internships that are not part of an accredited course and call for clearer definitions, consistent terminology, and targeted reform of student placement rules.</p><p><br></p><p>The key points are:</p><ul><li><strong>Internships</strong>&nbsp;should be defined in legislation and paid at least the National Minimum Wage if not part of a course.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>&nbsp;must be required: employers should state pay status and opportunity type in all adverts.</li><li><strong>Short unpaid tasters</strong>&nbsp;may be appropriate only where truly observational, short in duration, and with informed consent.</li><li><strong>Mandatory student placements</strong>&nbsp;should retain limited exemptions but with clearer boundaries and safeguards; nuanced reforms such as duration-based or apprenticeship-rate models are preferred to outright removal.</li><li><strong>Volunteering</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>work shadowing</strong>&nbsp;should be clearly distinguished from internships to avoid legal ambiguity and visa risks.</li><li><strong>Social mobility</strong>&nbsp;must be central: unpaid internships exclude those without financial means.</li><li><strong>Government should improve guidance and enforcement</strong>, ensuring plain-English communications and better public understanding of rights.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks to our members who helped shape our response to the consultation.
